# CPU Project

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of a CPU simulator with support for arithmetic and logical operations, as well as variable storage and manipulation. This project is to help help me understand the fundementals of OOP (object oriented programming) through programming a functional simulated CPU, Memory, and language and overloading operators. 

## Features
Arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Logical operations: AND, OR, NOT.
Variable storage: Numbers and Words can be stored and accessed from memory.
Overloaded operators: Allows intuitive usage of operators for arithmetic and logical operations.

## Overview
#### Challenges
Challenges faced in the project were primarily the design structure that best fit the project
#### Structure
- CPU class (responsible for preforming all operations)
- Memory Namespace (responsible for storing and indexing all variables (Number or Word))
- 3 classes responsible for all Data Types in the project
  - Variable Class (parent class)
  - Number and Word class (classes inheriting from Variable class - responsible for making a datatype and providing instructions to the cpu)

## Requirements
C++11
